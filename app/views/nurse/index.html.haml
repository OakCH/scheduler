  %p#instructions
    If you are happy with your nurses list and are ready to begin scheduling vacations for the 
    list, please click the Finalize Nurses button. This will send out the initial emails to all 
    nurses and begin the scheduling process. You will still be able to edit nurses individually 
    after this.

    %p
      Once you are done editing nurses, please proceed to Rules.
